Hey Guys This is Most Awaited kernel For Lg optimus me P350 It is Most fastest kernel Source.First it Was unstable But Now it is Fully working......


How to Compile it : 

First We Will Install Some Dependies : 

32 bit and 64 bit Systems : 

git-core gnupg sun-java6-jdk flex bison gperf libsdl-dev libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev

64 bit Only : 

ia32-libs lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib


Now We will Set up Repo :

mkdir -p ~/bin
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo


Now Your Computer is Ready For Compiling Kernel !!!!!!!!

mkdir kernel
cd kernel
git clone git@github.com:teampecan/2.6.35-kernel-for-lg-optimus-me-.git


Now you are Having the Sources For Kernel 


Now Compiling starts :
cd kernel
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=path_of_compiler    For example : export CROSS_COMPILE=../prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi    ( Notice ) This is Example You need To Set Tool chain Path According to your Toolchain Path 

If you don't have toolchain get it from here : ( Link im still Uploading it )

How to Set Toolchain : 

Download File From Following Given Link 
Now Extract it To your Home directory 


Now We can Start Compiling : 

cd kernel
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi

Now your Toolchain is ready : 

now if u want to make any changes 

make menuconfig ( do changes if u want and save it )
make -j3 ( i had done -j3 as im having i3 cpu change it according to ur pc ) 

Now your Kernel is Compiled Enjoy Guys !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
